# Tidymodels_examples
These are the materials for a one-day workshop on tidymodels. This workshop provides an introduction to machine learning with R using the tidymodels framework, a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles. 
We will build, evaluate, compare, and tune predictive models. Along the way, we'll learn about key concepts in machine learning including overfitting, resampling, and feature engineering. 
Learners will gain knowledge about good predictive modeling practices, as well as hands-on experience using tidymodels packages like parsnip, rsample, recipes, yardstick, tune, and workflows.
